# Stopping execution

> Throw errors to stop execution with recoverable errors

## Stopping execution with panic errors

:::warning

Use with caution. [See explanation](./stopping-execution#disclaimer)

:::

`panic` is equivalent to `throw` statement but as a function, it has the advantages :

- it can be used as an expression (ex: in ternary operator)
- it can be used as a parameter (ex: as a callback)

```typescript
import { panic } from '@w5s/error';

function unsafeAsNotNullable(value: unknown) {
  return value ?? panic(new TypeError('Value must not be nullable'));
}
```

## Stopping execution with a condition (assertion)

:::warning

Use with caution. [See explanation](./stopping-execution#disclaimer)

:::

`invariant` can be used to assert a condition. If the condition is false, it will throw an error with a descriptive message.

```typescript
invariant(
  condition, 
  // ✓ Describe what is wrong
  // ✓ Add a hint on how to fix it
  // ✓ Starts with upper case character
  // ex: '"A" is not a valid integer', 'Unexpected parameter "foo_bar"', ...
  '{{Invariant message}}'
);
```

Example

```typescript
import { invariant } from '@w5s/error';

function program() {
  invariant(true, 'This will not throw an error'); 
  // -> nothing
  invariant(false, 'This will throw an error'); 
  // -> throw InvariantError { message: 'Input should not be null' } when input is null or undefined

  //... do something with input
}
```
</details>

## FAQ

:::warning

### Use `throw` with caution : when the program should be stopped {#disclaimer}

In general, **throwing errors is discouraged**, instead [Result](../core/result) should be used.

Nevertheless, errors can be thrown when :

- Some condition is detected during runtime and the program cannot continue (i.e. assertion)
- Program is in an impossible logical state and should be stopped (i.e. panic)
