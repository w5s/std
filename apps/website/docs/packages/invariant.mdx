# Invariant

> Throw descriptive error in development, generic error in production.

<PackageBadgeGroup packageName="@w5s/invariant" apiHref="/api/invariant" />

## Motivation

This package provides a simple way to throw error from an assertion and a message.
It is built to be easily parsable / stripable at compile time.

## Installation

<PackageInstallBlock packageName="@w5s/invariant" />

## Usage

```ts
import { invariant } from '@w5s/invariant';

function program() {
  invariant(true, 'This will not throw an error'); 
  // -> nothing
  invariant(false, 'This will throw an error'); 
  // -> throw InvariantError { message: 'Input should not be null' } when input is null or undefined

  //... do something with input
}
```

## Coding Guide

:::warning

### Use `invariant` with caution

Generally speaking, **throwing errors is discouraged**.

Nevertheless, invariant should be thrown when :

- Program is in an impossible state and should be stopped (i.e. panic)
- An unexpected operation was done that was not caught during compile time

On the contrary, invariant should never be used to propagate logical errors.
For logical error, please see [Result](./core/result) section.
:::

```ts
invariant(
  condition, 
  // ✓ Describe what is wrong
  // ✓ Add a hint on how to fix it
  // ✓ Starts with upper case character
  // ex: '"A" is not a valid integer', 'Unexpected parameter "foo_bar"', ...
  '{{Invariant message}}'
);
```
