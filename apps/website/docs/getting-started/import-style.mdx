# Import style

> A guide to use the proper import style for your need

## Namespaces as Pseudo class

:::tip

W5S packages will almost never use classes. 
As a replacement, plain Javascript object are used as namespaces with corresponding type.

:::

Example :

```ts title="@w5s/xxx/src/SomeThing.ts"
import { SomeThing } from '@w5s/xxx';

export type SomeThing = ...; // <- Export type

/**
 * @namespace
 */
export const SomeThing = { // <- Export namespace
  // ...
};
```

```ts title="main.ts"
import { SomeThing } from '@w5s/xxx';

const someConst: SomeThing; // <- Used as a type
const someResult = SomeThing.someFunction(); // <- Used as a value
```

## Find the import style for your need

:::tip

Most of W5S modules can be imported in 3 different ways.
Each method has its own balance between conciness/simplicity VS performances, so it can fit better to your needs.

:::

Depending on the context, there are different ways to import modules

### `import { SomeThing } from '@w5s/xxx'`
> import from package root

**➕ Recommended :**

- When your project is an app
- When you use bundler (webpack, rollup, vite, etc.)

**➖ Not recommended :**

- When you need a high constraint on the bundle size

### `import { SomeThing } from '@w5s/xxx/dist/SomeThing.js'` 
> import from package namespace module

**➕ Recommended :**

- When your project is a library
- Both `type SomeThing` and `const SomeThing` are used in the file

**➖ Not recommended :**

- When you need a high constraint on the bundle size

### `import { someFunction } from '@w5s/xxx/dist/SomeThing/someFunction'`
> import from package namespace property module 

**➕ Recommended :**

- When your project is a library
- When you need to be really careful about bundle weight

**➖ Not recommended :**

- When you build an app (can be quite verbose)
